    <h1>Case Study: Contract Management</h1>
    <p>A company wants to have an overview of their contracts.</p>
  </div>

      <p>
        My first thought was to use a table to present the contracts. This felt
        like the most straightforward way to ensure structure and comparability.
        But tables can be tricky. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
        Tables can be hard to navigate on small screens, they often require
        horizontal scrolling, and they donâ€™t adapt well to flexible content
        lengths. From an accessibility perspective, screen readers can struggle
        if semantic markup isnâ€™t implemented correctly, and keyboard navigation
        across table rows and cells can quickly become frustrating.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address these issues while preserving the clarity of a tabular
        structure, I decided to offer an additional alternative view. This
        allows users to switch between views depending on their device,
        preferences, or access needs.

    <strong style="color: #9332ff">Keep in mind:</strong> Good design starts
    with understanding the people you're designing for. Assumptions and best
    practices are a useful foundation but theyâ€™re not enough. To create
    solutions that truly work, it's essential to validate ideas through testing
    and feedback. This ensures the design isnâ€™t just subjectively appealing, but
    functionally effective and accessible in real contexts.

        <h3>Common Pain Points</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Too much information can quickly feel overwhelming</li>
          <li>Diverse user needs are often overlooked</li>
          <li>Tables are difficult to read on small screens</li>
          <li>Scalability issues with long or inconsistent content</li>
          <li>
            Lack of semantic markup makes content inaccessible to screen readers
          </li>
          <li>Keyboard navigation can be frustrating</li>

        <h3>My Approach</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Alternative view for small screens and different needs</li>
          <li>Clear visual hierarchy and accessibility</li>
          <li>
            Interactive features like sorting, filtering, and column reordering
          </li>
          <li>
            Microinteractions for better feedback and flow (e.g. hover effects,
            undo toasts, loading animation)
          </li>
        </ul>
